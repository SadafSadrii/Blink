# Practicing to have 7 LEDs blinking 

The things I have used: Arduino Uno + Breadboard + 7 LEDs of different colors + 7 220 Ohm resistors + 8 Jumper wires 

Using the Ohm law, the resistior suited for the red, green and yellow is 160 Ohm (R= V/I : R = 5-1.8/0.02)
For the blue LED the desired resistor is 85 (R=5-3.3/0.02)

Please find the documentations in the issues.
