# Practicing to have 7 LEDs blinking 

The things I have used: Arduino Uno + Breadboard + 7 LEDs of different colors + 7 220 Ohm resistors + 8 Jumper wires 

The 220 Ohm resistor was calculated using the Ohm Law: R = V/I 

V being 5 and current being 0.02A. R= 250 ohm. The closest resistor to which that I had access to was 220
